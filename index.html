      <h3>Top two things to know about Hozier</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Claim to fame</li>
        <p>“Take Me to Church” is the debut single by Irish recording artist Hozier. It has become an international hit, reaching #1 in 12 countries, and has been certified five times platinum in the US. “Take Me to Church” was nominated for a Grammy Award for “Song of the Year” in 2015.</p>
        <li>Use of symbolism</li>
        <p>Hozier generously uses symbolism across all their songs. For example, in "Like Real People Do," Hozier uses “bog bodies” in Ireland, bodies which are exhumed after centuries of natural mummification, to describe a new relationship.</p>
